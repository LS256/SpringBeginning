# SpringBeginning

This repository include simple examples where Spring is used. Making these simple projects - decided also that applications written
in future will also include JUnit tests - it's quite convinient way of obtaining nice code.

This repository include following applications / fetures:
1. Finding n element of Fibonacci series. On user depends which element he would like to find.
2. Calculating area af basic geometrical figures like circle, rectangle, square, triangle and trapeze. This part was written in way, that
it can be extend by additional fetures like circular figure or similar.
